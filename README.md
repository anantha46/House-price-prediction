To build a machine learning model that can predict house prices based on various input features like location, number of rooms, income level, area population, etc., using the Random Forest Regression algorithm.

Random Forest is an ensemble learning method that builds multiple decision trees and combines their outputs to improve prediction accuracy and control overfitting.

In regression problems (like predicting house price), the output is the average of all the individual treesâ€™ predictions.

Advantages of Random Forest in House Price Prediction:
  Handles non-linear relationships between variables well.
  Resistant to overfitting.
  Works well with both numerical and categorical features.
  Provides insights through feature importance ranking.
